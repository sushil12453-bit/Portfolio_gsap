    "An AI-powered anti-cheating platform designed to monitor online exams using real-time camera detection and intelligent behavior tracking.",
  content:
    "Edu Gaurd is an AI-driven examination monitoring system built collaboratively by a team of four developers. The platform leverages TypeScript and advanced AI models to ensure fair and secure online assessments by detecting cheating behaviors through live camera analysis. It continuously monitors students’ movements and facial activity, flagging suspicious actions in real time. I contributed to developing the front-end interface and integrating TypeScript for type safety and scalability, ensuring a robust and maintainable codebase. The system’s architecture combines AI-based image processing with a responsive web interface, delivering a smooth and reliable user experience during exams. Through this project, I gained valuable experience in teamwork, AI integration, and building scalable, intelligent web applications that enhance academic integrity.",
